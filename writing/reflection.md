### Performance

Did the network's output make sense?
How could you adjust weights or activation functions to improve accuracy?
What did you notice about how small changes (e.g., weights) affect outcomes?

We calculated 2 scenarios of input values and weights, and notice that the larger the Weighted Sum, the closer the sigmoid function approaching 1. Small changes in weights(i.e. smaller weight) or values(i.e. larger values), the larger the Weighted Sum

This does not take into account factors like lifestyle, income, health, etc. 

### Reflection

It's easy to understand Neural Network, it's pretty intuitive.
